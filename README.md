React Starter App
-------------------


This is a starter template for React apps with a simple
setup so that time is spent more on coding rather than on config.


To set up locally on your machine:


    git clone https://github.com/snovosel/react_starter_template.git

    npm install


You're good to go!

To run the local webpack server:

    npm run build

    npm run start



Happy Coding :)
